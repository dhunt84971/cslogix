Create a PRD document for an application using the following description:

Using the source code found in the /home/dave/gitWorkspace/pylogix folder 
and its subfolders as an example, create a C# library that allows Ethernet 
based communications with Allen Bradley PLCs.  Use the example python code's 
function names.  The goal is to have a functioning C# library that can be 
referenced by a C# .NET Core application.

The bulk of the code is in the eip.py file.  Analyze this file when creating
the PRD such that it describes the functions that are to be converted.
